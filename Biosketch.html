  I am an assistant professor of Industrial Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. 
  Before joining <a href="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Departments/Industrial/">Pitt IE</a> 
  in the fall of 2020, I was a postdoc with joint appointments at MIT Institute for Data, Systems,
   and Society (<a href="https://idss.mit.edu/">IDSS</a>) and MIT 
   <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">Sloan</a> School of Management 
   (co-advised by <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~elmos/">Elchanan Mossel</a> 
   and <a href="https://www.deaneckles.com/">Dean Eckles</a>). I did my PhD in Electrical and 
   Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania (advised by <a href="https://jadbabaie.mit.edu/">Ali Jadbabaie</a>). 
  Broadly speaking my works are at the intersection of networks, data, and decision sciences. 
  I borrow tools from applied probability, statistics, algorithms, as well as decision and game 
  theory. Some of my current focus is on the challenges of inference and intervention design in 
  complex, large-scale sociotechnical systems, with applications ranging from online social 
  networks, e-commerce and collective decision/action platforms to public health, modern civilian 
  cyberinfrastructure and future battlefields. I am especially interested in the critical role 
  that information plays in the operation of sociotechnical institutions and its societal 
  implications, including on diversity, fairness and privacy. I have served on the program 
  committee of the 2021 ACM Economics and Computation conference, the 
  advisory council of the 2021 <a href="https://vaccineconfidencefund.org/">vaccine confidence fund</a> 
  (then a new industry alliance), as well as the program committees of EAAMO'22 (Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization), SocialSens2022 (Special Edition on
  Information Operation on Social Media) and the 2022 IISE annual meeting 
  (as the operations research track co-chair). I am currently serving on the program 
  committee of the 2023 ACM Economics and Computation conference. I have published in the Proceedings of the National 
  Academy of Sciences, Nature Human Behaviour, Nature Communications, the Operations Research journal, Automatica journal, and several IEEE Transactions. 
  At Pitt, I lead the <a href="http://sociotechnical.pitt.edu/">Sociotechnical Systems Research Lab</a> and teach Stochastic Processes (IE 2084), 
  Statistics (IE 2007), Design of Experiments (IE 1072), as well as a new engineering 
  elective called "Data for Social Good" (IE 1171) that is developed as part of the <a href="https://www.yearofdataandsociety.pitt.edu/">Pitt Year of Data and Society</a> initiative.
