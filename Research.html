<h2>Research</h2>
<p><div><img src="images/wordmap.png" align="right" width="280" border="0"/></div> My research is primarily concerned 
with the challenges of analysis and decision making in large scale sociotechnical systems such as online social networks 
and robotic sensor networks. Such systems operate in human (social and economic) as well as machine (dynamical and algorithmic) 
dimensions that are complex and conjoined. My work at the intersection of network and data sciences is motivated by applications 
that involve sociotechnical networks and the demand for models and techniques that can work with the massive detailed data 
collected about them.   </p>
<p>Scalable and resilient operation of large-scale networks is dependent on our ability to learn their properties from dispersed
observations (i.e., <b>distributed inference</b>) and our ability to influence them form localized action points 
(i.e., <b>decentralized interventions</b>). The main goal of my research is to facilitate these functionalities; first and foremost, 
by identifying paradigms that best describe and predict individual and aggregate behaviors. Such behaviors are shaped by the
interactions among network components (so-called agents) and they depend critically on the type and quality of the information 
available to each agent. Understanding these interactions helps us determine whether information transmission is efficient, 
and guides us through interventions that rely on information flow (e.g., decentralized control or seeding). My ultimate aim is 
to demonstrate the power of behavioral paradigms in control and design, where their application leads to improved policies 
and practices.    </p>
<p><img style="padding-bottom:1px; padding-right: 10px; float: left;" src="images/venResearch.png"  width="320" border="0"/> In technological
networks, I have contributed to problems of decentralized control and distributed estimation: achieving global objectives by 
injecting local inputs on the one hand, and learning system properties given restricted partial observations, on the other. 
On the social systems side, I have been interested in both the effectiveness of information transmission, sharing, 
and exchange through observed actions, as well as the effectiveness of decision-making using the available data. In fact, 
these issues are inter-related, as are control and estimation. On the one hand, the quality of decision-making depends on the 
available information. On the other hand, decisions reveal some of the information at disposal of the decision-maker.</p>
<p>I address these questions (distributed inference and decentralized interventions) through the lenses of network and data sciences, 
by relying on tools in probability,  graph theory, applied statistics and machine learning, algorithms and complexity, as well as 
control theory. These tools allow me to highlight key structural features that influence behavior; features such as presence of 
influential agents, observational and information asymmetries, data flow topology and heterogeneity.</p>

<h3><a name="DSMISS">Dynamic Structural Modeling, Inference and Interventions on Social Systems</a></h3>
<p>My postdoctoral research is focused on dynamic structural modeling to facilitate distributed inference 
and decentralized interventions on social systems. I am mostly interested in the development of structural models that take into account not only 
the statistical and causal dependencies between the (observable or latent) variables but also 
the behavioral mechanisms that influence the decision-makers in different situations. 
The latter often requires a deep understanding of social and human sciences to accurately 
characterize a decision scenario. Such models have the advantage of being amenable to policy 
interpretation while revealing the implications of the psychology of the mind in a particular 
scenario. Given the complexity of such models, Bayesian inference on them is often intractable. 
To overcome this intractability, my collaborators and I rely on approximate Bayesian computation 
and simulation-based techniques to perform inference, estimation, and prediction. 
The three processes that we are studying are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>social contagion </p>
</li>
<li><p>network formation</p>
</li>
<li><p>online reputation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Social Contagion</b>  refers to the spread of innovations (adoption of new behaviors or products)
through peer influence over social networks. Social contagion processes are classified into 
simple and complex depending on how much the probability of adoption increases with the number 
of adopters in oneâ€™s local neighborhood. In simple contagion, with each exposure, the user has 
an independent probability of adoption, while in complex contagion the adoption probability 
depends on whether or not enough reinforcement is achieved during the exposure. We study the 
type of contagion (simple versus complex), in terms of the activation functions (probability of 
adoption versus the number of adopters) and investigate the effects of network topology on the 
speed of diffusion.  We also use a deep learning inference architecture to classify such 
behaviors in a wide range of network structures and against a variety of plausible contagion 
models.</p>

<p><b>Network formation:</b> Pervasiveness of social and economic network data give rise to important 
questions about the formation and evolution of links between the networked entities (agents). 
A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of network formation has important 
implications for all manners of social policy and business strategy, where network interactions 
and externalities play a role. The existing literature in social science and economics addresses 
behavioral and strategic aspects of link formation (such as homophily and heterophily) by 
providing statistical evidence for the existence of such behaviors and characterizing their 
equilibrium implications under game theoretic models. However, there remains a demand for a 
comprehensive inference framework that reconciles the evolution of the observed interconnection
data with the strategic interactions of the agents. We study the evolution of network structure
as the agents form links over time according to their joint surplus from a general utility 
model. We use this generative model for training a neural network that infers the individuals&rsquo; 
preferences and other behavioral attributes affecting their link formation decisions.</p>

<p><b>Online reputation systems</b> constitute an important component of many electronic commerce platforms. 
Reviews and ratings posted on these platforms strongly influence the purchase and browsing behavior 
of customers, and play an important role in revenue generation. The existing literature in marketing, 
computer science, and economics highlights the statistical foundations of such impacts and addresses 
some of the behavioral and structural patterns that govern them (such as self-selection and reporting 
bias). These studies, however, fall short of a comprehensive framework to capture all aspects of online 
reputation dynamics that include the public perception of reviews, as well as the purchase and rating 
decisions. We develop a dynamic structural model for the evolution of reputation on an online 
e-commerce platform and use the proposed generative model to make inferences about individualsâ€™ rating 
behavior. We train a deep learning inference architecture with the simulated data from our generative 
model and test it on the real time-series data of reviews submitted on a popular e-commerce platform. 
The results reveal the circumstances under which these reviews are posted and their implications for 
the evolution of product ratings.</p>

<h3><a name="ATRDSN">Asymptotic Theory of Random Dynamic Systems and Networks</a></h3>
<p>Some of my more theoretical research is focused on developing tools that pioneer applications of random matrix 
theory in the modeling and analysis of large-scale networks and dynamic systems. Such tools have great potential 
for addressing questions whose depth and analytical complexity have impeded researchers so far. They are also 
very versatile and expressive when it comes to modeling and explaining structural features of very large-scale 
systems such as robotic swarms or the extremely high dimensional data sets that arise in the study of the 
Internet and online social networks. </p>

<h3><a name="ADNDS">Analysis and Design of Networked Dynamic Systems</a></h3>
<p>Networked dynamic systems build upon complex interactions between many co-evolving sub-components. 
Their industrial applications are plentiful and diverse ranging from chemical and biological processes
to robotics and the power grid. Our results touch upon many aspects of the analysis and design for 
such complex systems, including distributed detection, estimation, reliable design, and decentralized
control. My collaborators and I have been particularly interested in the following questions: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>How can we identify failures and structural variations from the observed dynamics of a limited number of output nodes? </p>
</li>
<li><p>How can we exercise control over the entire networks by accessing only a few of their input nodes? </p>
</li>
<li><p>How can we learn about environmental variables from the dispersed and disparate observations of different nodes in a network? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tools from control theory, optimization, signal processing, statistics, graph theory, combinatorics, and discrete 
algorithms have enabled us to propose effective solutions to each of these problems.</p>
<p><img src="images/disconnectingthedots.png" alt="network failures" width="340"></p>
<p>Some highlights from our results on the analysis and design of networked dynamic systems are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Protecting structural controllability against link and node failures (graph theory, combinatorics)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Efficient methods to rank links and nodes for the preservation of structural controllability (graph theory, combinatorics) </p>

<h3><a name="GDMSL">Group Decision Making and Social Learning</a> </h3>
<p>In <a href="http://web.mit.edu/rahimian/www/AminRahimianPhDThesis.pdf">my Ph. D. dissertation</a>, I studied the purely informational interactions of individuals in a group, 
where they receive private information and act based on that information while repeatedly observing 
each otherâ€™s beliefs or actions. Such situations arise for example in jury deliberations, expert committees,
medical diagnoses, etc. My collaborators and I developed parallel theories of group decision making following
the Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches. Our results indicate that the computations of a rational (Bayesian) 
decision-maker can scale up very fast with the increasing group size (NP-hardness). However, 
there are special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries, where these 
calculations simplify significantly. </p>
<p><img src="images/The_Jury_by_John_Morgan.jpg" alt="The Jury" width="340"></p>
<p><img src="images/roundtableDiscussion.jpg" alt="round table" width="300"></p>
<p>In the non-Bayesian framework, we propose the no-recall model of belief formation and decision making 
in groups, by relying on the time-one Bayesian update and using it for all future decision epochs. 
The no-recall model offers a behavioral framework for heuristic decision making that is rooted in the
Bayes rule but avoids the unrealistic complexities of rational inference. Our proposal is also 
consistent with a dual-process psychological theory of thinking: the group members behave 
rationally at the initiation of their interactions with each other (the slow and deliberative mode);
however, in the ensuing decision epochs, they rely on a heuristic that replicates their experiences
from the first stage (the fast automatic mode). These heuristics may be fitted for simple one-shot 
decision making but they fail to handle the complexities of a public discussion for group
decision-making. As a result, many inefficiencies arise in the outcome of such discussions and 
their roots can be traced to the underlying heuristic decision-making mechanisms. Two of the main
issues that arise in the study of decision-making organizations are information aggregation and
decision-flow architecture. Our formal theories of group decision-making provide structural 
insights into both of these issues and can be operationalized to avoid redundancy and increase 
the efficiency of the aggregate group-decision outcome among heuristic decision-makers.</p>
<p>Some highlights from our results on group decision making and social learning are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The characterizing the computational complexity of Bayesian group decisions (theory of computation)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Foundations of linear opinion dynamics (decision theory, Bayesian statistics) </p>
</li>
<li><p>A no-recall model of heuristic decision making in groups (decision theory, behavioral economics)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/aggregation.png" alt="non-bayesian aggregation" width="300"></p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Algorithmic, computational, and optimality aspects of decision-making in organizations are vastly unexplored. There are many untapped potentials for applying these techniques to improve the operations of teams in medical, legal and other industrial decision-making organizations. By investigating the effects of heuristics and biases, we can improve the practice of social and organizational policies, such that new designs can accommodate commonly observed biases, and work well in spite of them.</p>

<h3><a name="CDT">Controller Design and Tuning</a> </h3>
<p>The versatility and simplicity of proportional, integral and derivative (PID) 
actions have made them the most common form of feedback control, and almost 
universal all across the agriculture, transport, chemical and manufacturing 
industries, or even telecommunications and web services. Our ability to efficiently 
tune these controllers is key to their widespread adoption. My collaborators and 
I have advanced the state of the art in process control by proposing new ways of 
tuning feedback controllers. Our methods focus on explicit characterization of 
feasible domains in the control parameter space. Tools from complex analysis allow 
us to study the root boundaries of various polynomials that arise in the study of 
the feasible domains.  </p>
<p><img src="images/closed-loop-control-system.gif" alt="closed loop control system" width="300"></p>
<p>Fractional order control builds on a natural generalization of the integral and 
derivative feedback actions based on fractional order differential operators. 
We have successfully applied several of our techniques in the design and stabilization of fractional order controllers. Here are some of the 
highlights from our results on the design and tuning of feedback controller:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stability regions for fractional-order controllers and their integer approximations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Constrained tuning and parameter optimization over the feasible regions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using the stability region centroids for robust and non-fragile stabilization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/feasible_region_and_centroid.png" alt="feasible region centroid" width="300"></p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Ubiquitous adoption of proportional and integral actions for feedback control 
can be traced back to the industrial revolution. Improved tuning is essential 
as we encounter new challenging control applications in complex industrial 
processes. Fractional order controllers offer additional degrees of freedom 
in tuning, while preserving the essential structure of the PID feedback which 
is so popular in industrial applications.</p>
